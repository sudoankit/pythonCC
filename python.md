# Python

**Please use `python 3.x` only** as it makes everything easier to explain and not worry about the support and compability.

## This book...

... is mainly written for academia, in specific, the machine learning, vision and deep learning starters, those who have come from another platform such as `MATLAB`, `C++` etc and want to shift to Python.

This crash course is just like a list comprehension. 

**Q. Don't know what it is?**
_A. Then this book is for you._

**Q. You know what it is?**
_A. Good for you._

## Introduction

Python, by far is a great language to prototype and experiment. Academia is all about experimenting. 

Experimenting code is cheap, easy and fast than sticking electrodes into specifically,  genetically modified lab mice which cost 1000$! 

Jokes aside, I mean to say, it's good for health. Python has near [150k packages](https://pypi.org) which cover nearly every area of work in human knowledge. Of course, some weird stuff like the `fuckit` [package](https://github.com/ajalt/fuckitpy/blob/master/README.md), the [humour page at python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/humor/) and some interesting stuff like the `sh` [module](http://amoffat.github.io/sh/) which allows shell commands to run on python. 

There are many more interesting packages and this is a short, sweet, succint guide so excuse me for my brevity (and bad jokes,puns).

## History of Python

Who cares? 

## Installation

If you're using a `Linux` machine or `Mac`, basically anything born from `*nix`, you're good to go! ( I'm looking at you, Windows. ) 

If you're using Windows, search Google how to install python on the OS.

#### Linux

Your distro might already have it. 

Check using 

```
$ python3 --version 
Python 3.6.0 // you're good to go!

```

If you don't have go forward and quickly enter,

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6

```

#### MacOS

MacOS has python installed by default but you can get the latest version using `homebrew`, 

```
brew install python
```
Voila!

The deed is done. Congratulations on your fine taste and will to start your adventure to incorporate python in your daily tasks. 

Just before you start, your first exercise has arrived through 1-page delivery!

**Short note on the exercises:** 
There will be many, some easy, some hard, some cryptic. Be warned. I have **left some space** for you to enter the answers **for your satisfaction.** It's not possible to learn without practice. I'm positive you're going to skip some. 

Go ahead. It's your decision. I'm not going to ask you to answer them but I ask you to donate me some $ for a cup of tea everytime you skip one.

It's your choice. Buy me a cup of tea or do the exercise. 

The fate of the Universe is in your hands ( and this short note turned quite long, damn it!)
