# ( Quick ) Data Structures

Stiching the fairytale using data structures.


## The Obvious

The king had **42** rice grains, you give him the rice grains exponential to a chessboard. So, basically you give him **2^1** on the first day, **2^2** on the second day and so on.

You know the story right? Right?

How do we calculate the amount of rice on the 64th day?

Obviously, `42 + ( 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ... 2^64 )`

So, it's simple! In python you can do this: ( I suggest you using `iPython` or interactive python which allows you to directly execute python code ) 

Quick Question: Why can't we have something like `iC++` or `iJava`?

```

Hint: it's something to do with compilation.

Alright back to the king and his rice story.
