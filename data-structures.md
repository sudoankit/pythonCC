# Data Structures And The King's Friends

Stiching the fairytale using data structures.


## The Obvious

The king had **42** rice grains, you give him the rice grains exponential to a chessboard. So, basically you give him **2^1** on the first day, **2^2** on the second day and so on.

You know the story right? Right?

How do we calculate the amount of rice on the 64th day?

Obviously, `42 + ( 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ... 2^64 )`

So, it's simple! ( I suggest you using `iPython` or interactive python which allows you to directly execute python code )

Quick Question: Why can't we have something like `iC++` or `iJava`?

```


```

Hint: it's something to do with compilation.

Alright back to the king and his rice story.

So, fire up `iPython` ( just type `iPython` on the command line and press (enter, duh.)

```

( it's fine if you have anything in the form `Python 3.x.y`, don't worry, just use version **3**)

So the answer is simple, 

```

You'll get the answer! But, boy this is an headache! I mean just horizontal scrolling is painful. Who does that? 

We don't. I mean, I don't.

Enter, `loops`. The right hand of the king. 

### Anatomy of loops

Loops are crazy people as they keep repeating the same stuff again and again till eternity. Loops are the reason why we humans **need** computers.

Here `loops` profile picture.

```

LOOP x times {

	something like doing the dishes (x = forever)

} 

```

Amazing stuff isn't?
