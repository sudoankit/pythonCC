# Python Crash Course
Python Crash Course to kickstart _anything._

## Caveats:

This guide is more inclined for using python in academia, in particular machine learning, computer vision and deep learning with small bits of neuroscience.

I am trying to make it super packed and short but clean and clear ( _just like list comprehensions_ ) so it might go fast for beginners. I suggest you have a good understanding of python or any other object oriented language such as C++, Java etc.

Thank you and have fun!
